    "In the aftermath of the 2015 7.8 $M_w$ Gorkha earthquake, the National Planning Commission of Nepal conducted an extensive survey of the damage sustained by affected households. From the [2015 Nepal Earthquake Open Data portal](https://eq2015.npc.gov.np/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Following the 7.8 Mw Gorkha Earthquake on April 25, 2015, Nepal carried out a massive household survey using mobile technology to assess building damage in the earthquake-affected districts. Although the primary goal of this survey was to identify beneficiaries eligible for government assistance for housing reconstruction, it also collected other useful socio-economic information. In addition to housing reconstruction, this data serves a wide range of uses and users e.g. researchers, newly formed local governments, and citizens at large. The purpose of this portal is to open this data to the public._\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [DrivenData _Richter's Predictor_ competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/page/134/), the goal is to predict the level of damage based on geographic, structural, and socio-economical descriptors (building location, height, construction materials, number of resident families, etc.). A task ideally suited to tackle with a Random Forest classifier."
