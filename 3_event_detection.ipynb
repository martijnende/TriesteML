    "## Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will analyse timeseries data recorded by an acoustic sensor in a lab friction experiment (courtesy of Evangelos Korkolis, Utrecht University). During this experiment, the sample exhibited stick-slip deformation, the laboratory-scale analogue of earthquakes. Just prior to a major stick-slip event, the sample would start to emit tiny acoustic emissions (\"foreshocks\"), which are detected by piezo-electric sensors (\"seismometers\") installed around the sample. Some of these acoustic emissions are clearly visible in the timeseries, whereas others occur near the level of the noise. Classical methods (such as ST/LT thresholding) don't perform well on the smaller acoustic emissions, and so we will use machine learning to lower the automatic detection threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data description\n",
    "\n",
    "The training/testing data are small, randomly selected segments of acoustic timeseries data, each segment consisting of 1024 datapoints. Associated with each segment is a binary label that is `0` when the segment only contains noise, and is `1` when the segment contains one or more acoustic emissions. The training and testing data are shuffled, so that there is no temporal relation between the segments."
